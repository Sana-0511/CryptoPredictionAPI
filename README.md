# CryptoPredictionAPI

This is my submission for Innovation Hub project for CSE recruits.
The repository contains a jupyter (.ipynb) file, which has the complete code for Bitcoin Prediction.
I used a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural-network for predicting the bitcoin price for next one day. I directly import the BTC price dataset from yahoofinance. I am using data from 2019/01/01 to current for training the model and data from 2020/01/01 to current for testing the model. The code also compares Actual_prices (closing price of the data range) to Predicted_prices on a graph.
